To optimize the model, we can use different techniques such as ResNet or DenseNet. For this example, we will use the ResNet architecture and apply the following optimization techniques:

1. Data augmentation: This technique involves creating new training samples by applying transformations to the existing training samples. This can help the model to generalize better and improve its performance.

2. Early stopping: This technique involves stopping the training process when the performance of the model starts to degrade on the validation set. This can help to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.

3. Batch normalization: This technique involves normalizing the activations of the neurons in each batch of data. This can help to speed up the training process and improve the convergence of the model.

4. Dropout: This technique involves randomly dropping out a subset of the neurons in each layer during training. This can help to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.

5. Weight regularization: This technique involves adding a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of the weights of the model. This can help to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.
